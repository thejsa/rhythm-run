# Rhythm Run
Rhythm game for Nintendo 3DS.

This is not ready for prime time, and is probably not a good example for you to copy. Caveat emptor.

Licence: to be decided later; for now, don't copy this! it's not great and probably not exemplar quality at the moment :)

The audio included as `moonlight_sonata.opus` / `sample.opus` is a clip from [Paul Pitman's recording of Ludwig van Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, Op. 27 No. 2 - I. Adagio sostenuto, sourced from Musopen](https://musopen.org/music/2547-piano-sonata-no-14-in-c-sharp-minor-moonlight-sonata-op-27-no-2/) and in the public domain (trimmed and amplified using Audacity for file size reasons, then transcoded to 96 kb/s Opus using ffmpeg).
